        <p>
            My name is Anthony Moran. I am a <strong>Information</strong>Management & Technology major with a concentration in Data Analytics and Project Management, and I also have a minor in Psychology. I'm interested in exploring sports statistics or urban planning. I am an honors student and a recipient of the 1870 scholarship at Syracuse. I had an internship at the New York City Department of Housing Preservation & Development this summer, and I have experience working at a law office a few summers ago as well. At Syracuse, I am a Residential Advisor, which has given me ample experience being a leader. I like soccer and music.
